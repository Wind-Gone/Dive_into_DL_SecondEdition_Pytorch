# Dive into Deep Learning

[The first version：zh.D2L.ai](https://zh.d2l.ai/) | [The second version(not completed)：zh-v2.D2L.ai](https://zh-v2.d2l.ai/) | https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-zh

**Hi guys! This guide is for you:**

- **You want to focus on the application of deep learning rather than rigorous derivation**
- **You know Python.** 
- You have some knowledge about ML

# Let's get started

## Tools you'll need

- [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python 3+ is a better option.
- [IPython and the Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/).
- Some scientific computing packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - pytorch
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib

## Introduction

- This is an implementation of the PyTorch for Dive Into Deep Learning. 
- The original book has included some code demos, so the repo focuses on a secondary refinement and additional common operations. 
- Please let us know if there is anything wrong with it. I will be quite grateful that you have corrected my defects.
